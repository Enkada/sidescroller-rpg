# Welcome
Welcome to Sidescroller RPG! This guide will help you understand the basics of the game, from moving your character to engaging in combat and developing your hero.

# Movement
You can move your character left and right across the screen using the 'A' and 'D' keys. The game world is divided into different screens, and you can move between them by reaching the edge of a screen. When you enter a hostile area, there's a chance an enemy will spawn on the opposite side of the screen from where you entered. You can interact with various objects, non-player characters (NPCs), and initiate combat with enemies.

# Combat
Combat in Sidescroller RPG is turn-based and one-on-one. When you get close to an enemy, combat begins, and you always have the first move. On your turn, you can perform a basic attack or use one of your special abilities. Basic attacks don't consume any mana and are always available. Most actions will end your turn, but some abilities may allow you to perform additional actions. Abilities can also apply buffs to your character or debuffs to your opponent; these effects can sometimes stack, increasing their power. Some powerful abilities have a cooldown period before they can be used again. 

# Character Stats
Your character's effectiveness in combat is determined by three primary stats: Strength, Agility, and Intelligence.

# Character Progression
As you defeat enemies and complete quests, you will gain experience points (XP). When you level up, you receive 3 stat points to distribute among Strength, Agility, and Intelligence, and 1 ability point to spend in your talent tree to learn new skills.

# Equipment and Inventory
You have an inventory with 16 slots for items. You can equip your character with items in the following slots. Items can be found as loot from enemies or purchased from traders.
